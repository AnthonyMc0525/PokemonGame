Original pokemon game in progress.

Will be a pygames project.

All original code in src folder.

**For devs who work on the project:**

Create a virtual environment in the top level of the project:
`python3 -m venv ./venv`

To run the virtual environment run:
`source venv/bin/activate`

To leave the virtual environment:
`deactivate`

In a virtual environment install pygame and pytmx:
`pip3 install pygame`
`pip install pytmx`
